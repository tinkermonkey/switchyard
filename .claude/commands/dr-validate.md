# Validate Architecture Model

Comprehensive validation of the Documentation Robotics model including schema, naming, references, semantic rules, and cross-layer relationship validation.

## What This Command Does

1. Runs comprehensive validation on the architecture model:
   - Schema validation (JSON schema compliance)
   - Naming conventions (kebab-case, valid IDs)
   - Reference integrity (broken references)
   - Semantic rules (business logic, best practices)
   - **Cross-layer relationship validation** (existence, type, cardinality, format)
   - **Intra-layer relationship validation** (validated against relationship catalog)
2. Reports errors, warnings, and informational messages
3. Analyzes issues and suggests fixes with confidence scores
4. Provides actionable recommendations for fixes

## Usage

```
/dr-validate [--strict] [--validate-links] [--strict-links]
```

**Options:**

- `--strict`: Enable strict validation with comprehensive semantic rules
- `--validate-links`: Include comprehensive cross-layer and intra-layer relationship validation (recommended)
- `--strict-links`: Treat relationship warnings as errors (use with --validate-links)

## Instructions for Claude Code

When the user runs this command, perform intelligent validation with helpful suggestions.

### Step 1: Run Initial Validation

**RECOMMENDED: Always include relationship validation**

```bash
dr validate --strict --validate-links
```

**Basic validation** (default):

```bash
dr validate
```

**Comprehensive validation with link checking**:

```bash
dr validate --strict --validate-links --strict-links
```

**Most thorough validation**:

```bash
dr validate --strict --validate-links --strict-links
```

### Relationship Validation

Cross-layer and intra-layer relationship validation checks:

1. **Existence**: Target elements exist
2. **Type**: Correct element types referenced
3. **Cardinality**: Single values vs arrays correct
4. **Format**: Valid element ID format (UUID, paths, durations)
5. **Catalog Compliance**: Intra-layer relationships exist in relationship catalog

### Step 2: Parse and Categorize Results

Group validation results by severity:

- **Errors** (❌): Must fix (breaks model integrity)
- **Warnings** (⚠️): Should fix (best practices)
- **Info** (ℹ️): Consider (suggestions)

### Step 3: Analyze and Present Results

Present results in a clear, organized format:

```
Validation Results
==================

Summary:
❌ 3 errors
⚠️  5 warnings
ℹ️  2 info

Errors (must fix):

1. ❌ business.service.orders
   Location: documentation-robotics/model/02_business/services.yaml:15
   Issue: Missing 'realizes' cross-layer reference
   Impact: No traceability to application layer

   Suggested fix:
   → Add reference to application service
   Command: dr update business.service.orders \
     --property realizes=application.service.order-api

2. ❌ application.service.payment-api
   Location: documentation-robotics/model/04_application/services.yaml:23
   Issue: Critical service has no security policy
   Impact: High-risk service is unsecured

   Suggested fix:
   → Add authentication scheme
   Command: dr add security policy \
     --name "Payment API Authentication" \
     --property applies_to=application.service.payment-api

[Continue for all errors...]

Warnings (should fix):
[List warnings with suggestions...]

Info (suggestions):
[List informational items...]
```

### Step 4: Suggest Fixes

For each issue, provide:

1. **Clear explanation**: What's wrong and why it matters
2. **Specific fix**: Exact command to resolve
3. **Confidence level**: How certain you are this is the right fix
4. **Risk assessment**: Is this safe to auto-fix?

#### Fix Confidence Levels

**High confidence** (✓ Auto-fix safe):

- Broken references with obvious targets
- Missing descriptions (can infer from name)
- Naming convention fixes
- Missing IDs (can generate)

**Medium confidence** (⚠ Review recommended):

- Security policy selection (multiple options)
- Goal associations (requires domain knowledge)
- Criticality levels (business decision)

**Low confidence** (❌ Manual review required):

- Complex traceability issues
- Architectural decisions
- Business-specific requirements

### Step 5: Apply Fixes (if requested)

When user requests fixes:

1. **Show fix plan**: List all fixes to be applied
2. **Separate by risk**: Group safe vs. risky fixes
3. **Get confirmation**: Always ask before applying changes
4. **Apply approved fixes**: Execute commands sequentially
5. **Re-validate**: Confirm fixes resolved issues
6. **Report results**: Show what was fixed and what remains

#### Auto-Fix Process

```bash
# Get user confirmation
"I found 8 issues. Here's my fix plan:

Safe to auto-fix (5):
✓ Add missing descriptions (3 elements)
✓ Fix naming conventions (2 elements)

Require review (3):
⚠ Select security policies (2 services)
⚠ Associate with goals (1 service)

Apply safe fixes now? (I'll ask about the others)"

# If yes, apply safe fixes
dr update business.service.orders \
  --property description="Manages customer orders"

dr update business.service.shipping \
  --property description="Handles shipping logistics"

# ... continue for all safe fixes

# Re-validate
dr validate

# Report
"✓ Applied 5 fixes
✓ Re-validated

Remaining issues: 3 (require review)
[Show remaining issues with recommendations]"
```

### Step 6: Handle Different Validation Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Clean Model (No Issues)

```
✓ Validation passed!

Model is healthy:
- 0 errors
- 0 warnings
- All cross-layer references valid
- Naming conventions followed
- Semantic rules satisfied

Great job! Your model is well-structured.
```

#### Scenario 2: Minor Issues (Warnings Only)

```
⚠️ Validation passed with warnings

Summary: 0 errors, 3 warnings

Your model is valid but could be improved:

1. ⚠️  business.service.checkout
   Recommendation: Add 'supports-goals' reference for traceability
   Impact: Helps trace business value

2. ⚠️  application.service.reporting
   Recommendation: Add monitoring metrics
   Impact: Improves observability

3. ⚠️  api.operation.create-payment
   Recommendation: Consider adding rate limiting
   Impact: Protects against abuse

Would you like me to address these warnings?
```

#### Scenario 3: Critical Errors

```
❌ Validation failed

Summary: 3 errors, 2 warnings

Critical issues found:

1. ❌ application.service.payment-api
   Error: References non-existent business.service.payment
   Impact: Broken traceability chain
   Fix: Create business service or update reference

2. ❌ Invalid ID format: business.service.Order_Management
   Error: Must use kebab-case
   Impact: Violates naming convention
   Fix: Rename to: business.service.order-management

3. ❌ security.policy.pci-dss
   Error: Applies to non-existent application.service.payment
   Impact: Security policy orphaned
   Fix: Update reference or remove policy

I can fix #2 automatically (rename).
#1 and #3 require your input - which service should they reference?
```

#### Scenario 4: Pattern Detection

Look for patterns in errors to provide higher-level guidance:

```
Detected patterns:

🔍 Security Gap (3 services)
   All critical services should have security policies.
   Found 3 critical services without policies:
   - application.service.payment-api
   - application.service.order-api
   - application.service.user-api

   Fix: /dr-model Add authentication policies to critical services

🔍 Missing Monitoring (5 services)
   Critical services should have APM metrics.
   Found 5 critical services without metrics:
   [list services...]

   Fix: /dr-model Add availability and latency metrics

🔍 Broken Traceability (2 services)
   Application services should realize business services.
   Found 2 application services with no 'realizes' reference:
   [list services...]

   Fix: Review each service and add business service references
```

### Step 7: Provide Actionable Next Steps

Based on validation results, suggest specific actions:

```
Next steps:

Priority 1 (Critical):
1. Fix broken references (3 errors)
   → I can help fix these (ask me to apply fixes)

Priority 2 (Security):
2. Add security policies to critical services
   → Run: /dr-model Add OAuth2 authentication for payment API

Priority 3 (Monitoring):
3. Add APM metrics for critical services
   → Run: /dr-model Add availability metrics to critical services

Priority 4 (Documentation):
4. Add descriptions to 5 elements
   → I can help fix these with high confidence
```
