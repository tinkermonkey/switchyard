# Motivation Layer Skill

**Layer Number:** 01
**Specification:** Metadata Model Spec v0.7.0
**Purpose:** Captures stakeholder concerns, goals, requirements, and constraints that drive architectural decisions using ArchiMate motivation elements.

---

## Layer Overview

The Motivation Layer is the **highest layer** in the 12-layer architecture and provides governance to all other layers. It describes:

- **WHY** - The reasons and drivers behind architectural decisions
- **WHO** - Stakeholders with interests in the outcome
- **WHAT** - Goals, requirements, principles, and constraints
- **VALUE** - The worth and importance of business outcomes

This layer uses **ArchiMate 3.2 Motivation Layer** standard without custom extensions.

## Cross-Layer References

**Motivation Layer is the highest layer** - It does **NOT reference any lower layers**. Instead, lower layers reference UP to this layer for governance.

### Incoming References (Lower Layers → Motivation)

| Layer                     | References Motivation For                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layer 2 (Business)**    | BusinessService delivers Value, supports Goals, governed by Principles; BusinessActor is Stakeholder; Contract drives Constraints |
| **Layer 3 (Security)**    | Actor references Stakeholder; ActorObjective references Goal; Threat references Assessment; Countermeasure implements Requirement |
| **Layer 4 (Application)** | ApplicationService supports Goals, delivers Value, governed by Principles; ApplicationFunction fulfills Requirements              |
| **Layer 5 (Technology)**  | TechnologyService supports Goals, governed by Principles; Node fulfills Requirements, constrained by Constraints                  |
| **Layer 6 (API)**         | Operation supports Goals (x-supports-goals), fulfills Requirements, governed by Principles, constrained by Constraints            |
| **Layer 7-12**            | All layers can reference Principles, Constraints, Requirements, Goals for governance and traceability                             |

**Design Pattern:** Lower layers "look up" to the Motivation layer to justify WHY they exist and WHAT value they deliver.

---

## Codebase Detection Patterns

The Motivation Layer is typically **NOT extracted from code** but documented separately. However, certain patterns suggest the need for motivation elements:

### Pattern 1: Requirements Traceability Comments

```python
# REQUIREMENT: REQ-001 - User authentication must support OAuth 2.0
# GOAL: Improve security and user experience
# PRINCIPLE: Security by design

def configure_oauth(provider: str):
    pass
```

**Maps to:**

- Requirement entity (REQ-001)
- Goal entity (improve security)
- Principle entity (security by design)

### Pattern 2: Non-Functional Requirements in Tests

```python
@npm test.mark.performance
def test_api_response_time():
    """Verify API responds within 200ms (GOAL: sub-second response)"""
    response_time = measure_api_call()
    assert response_time < 0.2  # Constraint: < 200ms
```

**Maps to:**

- Goal (sub-second response)
- Constraint (< 200ms)
- Requirement (performance requirement)

### Pattern 3: Configuration Constants

```python
# Constraint: Budget limit for cloud spending
MAX_MONTHLY_CLOUD_COST = 10000  # USD

# Principle: Data residency compliance
ALLOWED_REGIONS = ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]  # Constraint: US-only

# Goal: 99.99% availability
TARGET_UPTIME_SLA = 0.9999
```

**Maps to:**

- Constraint entities (budget, region)
- Goal (availability target)
- Principle (data residency)

### Pattern 4: README/Documentation Headers

```markdown
## Goals

- Achieve 99.9% system availability
- Reduce customer onboarding time to < 5 minutes
- Support 10,000 concurrent users

## Principles

- API-first architecture
- Microservices over monoliths
- Security by design

## Constraints

- Budget: $500K for 2024
- Timeline: Launch by Q3 2024
- Technology: Must run on AWS
```

**Maps to:** Direct creation of Goal, Principle, and Constraint entities

## Modeling Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Stakeholders

Start by documenting **WHO cares** about the system:

```bash
# Add key stakeholders
dr add motivation stakeholder "End Users" \
  --properties type=external \
  --description "Customers using the platform"

dr add motivation stakeholder "Product Manager" \
  --properties type=internal \
  --description "Defines product vision and priorities"

dr add motivation stakeholder "Compliance Team" \
  --properties type=internal \
  --description "Ensures regulatory compliance"
```

### Step 2: Document Drivers and Assessments

Identify **WHAT is pushing** the organization:

```bash
# Market driver
dr add motivation driver "Cloud Migration Pressure" \
  --properties category=market \
  --description "Industry shift to cloud-native architectures"

# SWOT assessment
dr add motivation assessment "Legacy System Debt" \
  --properties assessmentType=weakness \
  --description "Monolithic architecture limits agility"

dr add motivation assessment "Strong Engineering Team" \
  --properties assessmentType=strength \
  --description "Experienced team with cloud expertise"
```

### Step 3: Define Goals and Values

Articulate **WHAT we want to achieve**:

```bash
# Strategic goal
dr add motivation goal "Modernize Architecture" \
  --properties priority=critical,measurable=true,target-date=2024-12-31 \
  --description "Migrate to microservices architecture"

# Value delivered
dr add motivation value "Operational Efficiency" \
  --properties type=operational \
  --description "Reduced deployment time and increased reliability"
```

### Step 4: Specify Requirements and Principles

Define **HOW we will operate**:

```bash
# Functional requirement
dr add motivation requirement "API Authentication" \
  --properties type=functional \
  --description "All API endpoints must authenticate users"

# Guiding principle
dr add motivation principle "API-First Design" \
  --properties category=application \
  --description "All services expose RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specs"

# Hard constraint
dr add motivation constraint "AWS-Only Infrastructure" \
  --properties type=technology \
  --description "All services must deploy to AWS (no multi-cloud)"
```

### Step 5: Establish Relationships

Connect motivation elements using predicates:

```bash
# Driver influences Goal
dr relationship add "motivation/driver/cloud-migration-pressure" \
  influences "motivation/goal/modernize-architecture"

# Goal realizes Value
dr relationship add "motivation/goal/modernize-architecture" \
  realizes "motivation/value/operational-efficiency"

# Principle influences Requirement
dr relationship add "motivation/principle/api-first-design" \
  influences "motivation/requirement/api-authentication"

# Stakeholder influences Goal
dr relationship add "motivation/stakeholder/product-manager" \
  influences "motivation/goal/modernize-architecture"

# Assessment influences Goal
dr relationship add "motivation/assessment/legacy-system-debt" \
  influences "motivation/goal/modernize-architecture"
```

### Step 6: Validate

```bash
dr validate --layer motivation
dr validate --validate-relationships
```

## Traceability Patterns

### Pattern 1: Goal Decomposition Hierarchy

```
Strategic Goal: "Improve Customer Satisfaction"
├── aggregates → Business Goal: "Reduce Response Time"
│   ├── aggregates → Operational Goal: "Achieve <100ms API Latency"
│   └── aggregates → Operational Goal: "Implement Caching Layer"
└── aggregates → Business Goal: "Improve Mobile Experience"
    ├── aggregates → Operational Goal: "Launch iOS App"
    └── aggregates → Operational Goal: "Launch Android App"
```

### Pattern 2: Requirement Hierarchy

```
Business Requirement: "Secure User Data"
├── aggregates → Functional Requirement: "Encrypt Data at Rest"
│   └── influences → Technical Requirement: "Use AES-256 Encryption"
├── aggregates → Functional Requirement: "Encrypt Data in Transit"
│   └── influences → Technical Requirement: "Use TLS 1.3"
└── aggregates → Compliance Requirement: "GDPR Data Protection"
    └── influences → Technical Requirement: "Right to Deletion API"
```

### Pattern 3: Principle Application

```
Principle: "Cloud-Native Architecture"
├── influences → Requirement: "Containerized Deployments"
├── influences → Requirement: "Stateless Services"
├── influences → Constraint: "No On-Premise Infrastructure"
└── realizes → Value: "Scalability and Resilience"
```

### Pattern 4: Stakeholder → Goal → Implementation Chain

```
Stakeholder: "CEO"
└── influences → Goal: "Reduce Operating Costs by 20%"
    ├── influences → Requirement: "Automated CI/CD Pipeline"
    ├── influences → Principle: "Infrastructure as Code"
    └── realizes → Value: "Financial Efficiency"
        └── (lower layers reference this chain)
```

## Common Modeling Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Feature Justification

**Question:** "Why are we building this feature?"

**Approach:**

1. Add **Stakeholder** who requested it
2. Add **Driver** (market, customer, regulatory)
3. Add **Goal** the feature achieves
4. Add **Value** delivered
5. Lower layers reference the Goal

### Scenario 2: Regulatory Compliance

**Question:** "How do we track GDPR compliance?"

**Approach:**

1. Add **Driver** ("GDPR Regulation")
2. Add **Constraint** ("Data Residency: EU only")
3. Add **Requirement** ("Right to Deletion", "Data Portability")
4. Add **Principle** ("Privacy by Design")
5. Security layer references these elements

### Scenario 3: Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**Question:** "Document why we chose microservices?"

**Approach:**

1. Add **Assessment** (strength/weakness of monolith)
2. Add **Principle** ("Microservices Architecture")
3. Add **Goal** ("Improve Deployment Frequency")
4. Add **Constraint** ("Team size supports distributed ownership")
5. Application layer references the Principle

## ArchiMate Integration

When exporting to ArchiMate format:

```bash
dr export archimate --layer motivation --output motivation.archimate
```

**Supported ArchiMate Elements:**

- `Stakeholder` → ArchiMate Stakeholder
- `Driver` → ArchiMate Driver
- `Assessment` → ArchiMate Assessment
- `Goal` → ArchiMate Goal
- `Outcome` → ArchiMate Outcome
- `Principle` → ArchiMate Principle
- `Requirement` → ArchiMate Requirement
- `Constraint` → ArchiMate Constraint
- `Meaning` → ArchiMate Meaning
- `Value` → ArchiMate Value

**Supported Relationships:**

- `aggregates`, `realizes`, `specializes`, `influences`, `associated-with`

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Stakeholders** - Understand WHO before WHAT
2. **Use SMART Goals** - Make goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
3. **Distinguish Requirements from Constraints**:
   - **Requirement**: "System MUST authenticate users" (functional need)
   - **Constraint**: "System MUST use OAuth 2.0" (limits HOW requirement is met)
4. **Link Principles to Requirements** - Every requirement should trace to a principle or goal
5. **Use Assessments for Trade-offs** - Document strengths/weaknesses to justify decisions
6. **Track Outcomes** - Update outcome status as goals are achieved
7. **Don't Over-Document** - Focus on high-value motivation elements that drive decisions

## Validation Tips

Common validation issues:

| Issue                  | Cause                                   | Fix                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Orphaned Goal          | No stakeholder influences it            | Add stakeholder or driver that influences goal  |
| Unrealized Requirement | No goal justifies it                    | Link requirement to goal or principle           |
| Unused Principle       | No requirements reference it            | Either apply principle or remove it             |
| Missing Value          | Goals don't realize any value           | Add value elements and link goals               |
| No Traceability        | Lower layers don't reference motivation | Add references from business/application layers |
